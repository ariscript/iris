# Triggered SDMA

Triggered SDMA moves data that a running kernel produces without spending compute units on the
transfer. The host pre-arms copy-engine (SDMA) chains that wait on *gates*; the kernel opens a
gate when its data is written, and the copy engine copies the data to every peer and signals its
arrival there.

```
kernel writes a batch ──► publish(batch) opens the gate
                               │
          copy engine:  POLL_REGMEM(ready >= epoch) ─► COPY × segments ─► ATOMIC(peer arrival += 1)
                               │
peer kernel:  wait(batch) ◄────┘
```

The API is `iris.triggered`; see the [reference](../reference/host/triggered.md).

## Model

- A **segment** is one copy: a byte range, or a 2D sub-window (rows of a strided tensor). It is
  written at the same offset in each peer's buffer.
- A **batch** is an ordered group of segments behind one gate, with one arrival signal per peer.
  Batching amortizes the poll and the signal over many copies.
- A batch has **contributors**: the number of `publish` calls that complete it each epoch. One for
  a batch written by a single CTA; the number of CTAs for a batch they write together.
- A **schedule** lists a rank's batches in the order its producer completes them. The plan arms
  them in that order on each peer's queue.

`iris.triggered.schedule` builds schedules for common producers: `whole()` (one batch, published
once per program at the end), `chunks()` (row blocks completed in order) and `waves()` (one batch
per wave of a persistent tiled kernel, such as a GEMM). Any list of batches works.

```python
from iris.triggered import TriggeredPlan, TriggeredView, waves

ctx = iris.iris(heap_size, allocator_type="vmem_chunked")
out = ctx.zeros(world_size * M, N, dtype=torch.bfloat16)
schedules = [waves(out[r * M : (r + 1) * M], (BM, BN), num_programs, base=out) for r in range(world_size)]
plan = TriggeredPlan(ctx, out, schedules)          # collective: allocates gates, arms epoch 1

for step in range(steps):
    view = plan.begin_device_epoch()
    producer[(num_programs,)](..., view)           # TriggeredView.initialize(view).publish(batch)
    plan.end_device_epoch()                        # every batch arrived and drained
    ...
    plan.next_epoch()                              # barrier, re-arm, barrier
plan.destroy()
```

### Gluon

Gluon kernels use `iris.gluon.TriggeredView`. It reads the same view tensor and has the same
methods as the Triton `TriggeredView`, so the host side does not change:

```python
from iris.gluon import TriggeredView

@gluon.jit
def producer(out, view, ...):
    ...                                            # write this program's part of the batch
    TriggeredView.initialize(view).publish(batch)
```

`publish` waits for vector-memory stores, including AMD buffer stores (`buffer_store`). Call it
after `gl.warp_specialize` returns, not inside a partition.

## The kernel author's contract

1. **Batches complete in schedule order.** All of a rank's chains to one peer share one queue and
   run strictly in arming order, so a batch completed early waits for every batch armed before it.
   Out-of-order completion is still correct, only slower. A persistent kernel whose programs each
   work through their tiles in order completes waves in order by construction.
2. **Each batch gets exactly `contributors` publishes per epoch,** each after the caller's writes
   to that batch. `publish` must be called by the whole CTA, outside divergent branches.
3. **A producer never waits on its own plan's arrivals before it has published everything it
   contributes to.** Its wait could depend on a chain parked behind one of its own unpublished
   batches.
4. **Segment sizes are fixed when the plan is created.**
5. **`arrived`, `wait` and `reusable` are called uniformly across the CTA:** every wave makes the
   same number of calls. Each is one atomic whose result reaches the other waves through a CTA
   barrier, so a polling loop must not exit on a per-wave condition (such as a clock read):
   waves would read the result before it is written, or deadlock. Count polls instead.

Plans that share queues must begin, and be aborted, in the order they were armed. While chains
are armed on a queue, host `Iris.put()` and `quiet()` to that peer raise rather than queue behind
them.

## Memory ordering

Measured on 8× MI350X (gfx950) and 8× MI300X (gfx942).

**Producer.** Copy engines read memory behind the GPU's L2, so a batch's data must be written
back before its gate opens. A release fence only covers the issuing wave, so every wave of the
CTA must first complete its stores. `publish` does this:

```python
wait_cnt()                 # s_waitcnt vmcnt(0): this wave's stores are done
tl.debug_barrier()         # every wave's stores are done
tl.atomic_add(counter, 1, sem="acq_rel", scope="sys")   # the last contributor then:
tl.atomic_xchg(ready, epoch, sem="release", scope="sys")
```

| Release recipe                                  | Stale data at the peer (256 KiB and 4 MiB) |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `wait_cnt` + barrier + release (`gpu` or `sys`) | none in 350 epochs                         |
| release without the barrier                     | 80–100% of epochs                          |
| `.wt` store of the gate                         | every element, every epoch                 |
| plain store                                     | none, but the gate stays in L2 until kernel exit |

**Consumer.** `arrived` / `wait` read the arrival gate with an acquire at system scope; data read
after it in the same kernel is fresh (no stale elements over 9,600 tile-epochs).

## Gates and epochs

- Each batch has a 64-byte gate row: `ready`, `arrival`, `completion` (64-bit), `error`, and a
  contributor counter. The copy engine polls the low 32 bits of `ready` with `>=`.
- Epochs start at 1 and add 1 per `next_epoch()`. Gates are never reset, so a plan is limited to
  2³² − 1 epochs.
- `end_device_epoch()` checks completion with a kernel: this rank's batches published and arrived
  at every peer (each chain ends with that signal), and every other batch arrived here.

## Requirements and limits

- **Stable peer mappings.** Armed chains hold peer addresses, so the heap must not re-map peers
  while chains are armed. Create the context with `allocator_type="vmem_chunked"` (or `"vmem"`):
  both keep peer addresses fixed, and the chunked allocator maps new chunks into each peer's
  reserved range as the heap grows. The default torch allocator re-maps peer heaps on every
  allocation and is rejected.
- **One queue per peer.** Plans use the host-initiated copy-engine queue to each peer, shared with
  host `Iris.put()`. Kernel-initiated copies (`put(..., use_copy_engine=True)`) use a separate
  queue and are unaffected.
- **Ring capacity.** Armed chains may use at most half of each queue's 8 MiB ring.
- **Single node only.**
- **Linear segments are at most 1 GiB** (SDMA 4.4's count field is 30 bits). The schedule builders
  split larger ranges.
